<!-- Plain HTML action="#" is just a placeholder; it will be replaced by th:action="@{/}" which @{} is a link (URL)
expression. Here it builds the URL '/' respecting the app context path. Sets the "selection target" for *{} expressions
(typically a form-backing bean) to the object productNameQuery which is a reference to a dto. -->
<form action="#" th:action="@{/}" th:object="${productNameQuery}" method="post">

    <!--Sets the label that binds to the clients input request from the form-->
    <label for="productName">Product Name:</label>

    <!-- th:field binds this input to the property 'productName' of the th:object -->
    <!-- *{} is a "selection" expression: resolved relative to th:object -->
    <input type="text" th:field="*{productName}" id="productName"/>


    <!-- th:if conditionally renders this span only when there are field errors. ${} is a variable expression (evaluated
    against the model). #fields is a Spring MVC utility object to work with binding/validation -->
